# RetroFE Documentation Project

Welcome to the RetroFE documentation project. The purpose of this
project is to provide documentation regarding the usage of the RetroFE
front-end, and all its features.

RetroFE is a front-end, which can be used as a graphical user interface
to display, select and launch your games, videos, and programs. Its most
common usage is for game emulation. RetroFE allows you to define
collections, which can be displayed using a menu structure with
additional artwork like video, box art, screenshots, etc.
